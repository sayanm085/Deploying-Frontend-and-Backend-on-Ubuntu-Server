You **can** use Redux for managing API data, but **React Query is a better choice** for fetching and caching API data efficiently.

## 🚀 **Why Use React Query Instead of Redux for API Data?**  

| Feature                 | React Query ✅         | Redux Toolkit ❌      |
|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Automatic Caching**   | ✅ Yes (Built-in)    | ❌ No (Manual)      |
| **Background Refetching** | ✅ Yes (Auto Update) | ❌ No (Needs Extra Code) |
| **Optimized for API Calls** | ✅ Yes (Less Re-fetching) | ❌ No (Re-fetch on every load) |
| **Code Simplicity** | ✅ Less Boilerplate  | ❌ More Setup |
| **Data Sync** | ✅ Auto Syncs with API  | ❌ Manual State Updates |
| **Ideal For** | ✅ API Fetching, Caching, Server State | ❌ Global UI State Management |

### 🚎 **Redux is NOT the best choice for API calls because:**
1. **No Built-in Caching:** Redux does not cache API data automatically. You need to handle it manually.  
2. **More Code:** You need reducers, actions, dispatchers, and selectors.  
3. **Re-fetch on Every Page Load:** Without manual caching, Redux will fetch data **every time** the page reloads.  
4. **Not Optimized for API Calls:** Redux is great for **global UI state**, but **React Query is built specifically for API state.**

## ✅ **When to Use Redux?**  
Use Redux **ONLY** if:  
✔️ You need **global state management** (e.g., user authentication, theme settings).  
✔️ You want **data persistence across different pages** (e.g., cart items in an eCommerce site).

## 🔥 **When to Use React Query?**  
Use React Query if:  
✔️ You are **fetching API data** (like your homepage API).  
✔️ You need **auto-caching & re-fetching** without writing extra code.  
✔️ You want **faster API performance** and avoid unnecessary re-fetching.

## 🏆 **Best Approach for Your Project**  
Since your **homepage fetches API data once** and passes it to multiple components, **React Query is the best option!**  

✅ **Fast API Fetching**  
✅ **Automatic Caching**  
✅ **Less Code, More Performance**  

If you need **authentication, cart management, or UI state**, **use Redux** for that—but **React Query should handle API fetching.**  

🚀 **Final Verdict:** **Use React Query for API calls and Redux for UI state management.**  

Let me know if you want a Redux implementation, but it will be more complex! 🔥
